		<p>“All science is either Physics or stamp collecting” - Ernest Rutherford."</p>

		<p><strong>Discuss.</strong></p>

		<p>As Richard Feynman once said, “physics is the most fundamental science and is ‘all inclusive’ of the sciences” [1]. But to what extent can physics be put on a pedestal?</p>

		<p>Before quantum mechanics, the idea of Laplace’s demon states that if (the demon) can know the exact momentum and position of each atom at a given time, then the past and future events can be predicted [2]. We now know that quantum mechanics “disarms” this demon. Physics can come close to predicting and answering many phenomena that occur in the macroscopic realm, but the future predictions in the microscopic realm are indeterminate. The goal of science is to understand, explain and make predictions of events in the natural world, yet, physics cannot be considered freed from all imperfections; bound by the rules of our probabilistic reality, the perception of physics being purely deterministic breaks down.</p>

		<p>As the most fundamental science, the explanations of events in the natural world can be answered through physics. However, trying to understand a biological or chemical process through the lens of physics is neither feasible nor efficient, as predictions in quantum mechanics, dealing with the atomic and subatomic world, are probabilistic and indefinite. This is where a macroscopic approach, experimenting through direct observation and measurement of the event, is more beneficial to reach a conclusion.</p>

		<p>In this technological era, supercomputers are used to perform computationally-intensive calculations and analyse copious amounts of data. However, not only do they consume 17.8 megawatts of power, sufficient to run 900,000 light bulbs, but may also take lifetimes performing certain tasks [3,4]. One such example of another science contributing to the physical realm of computing is the modelling of a biological supercomputer, which uses a similar biological process found in the brain, allowing multiple operations to be simultaneously performed with a mere 20 watts of power [4]. Compared to a traditional supercomputer, the new biological supercomputer is about as small as a book, energy-efficient, and quicker at solving certain problems [3,4]. Understanding electricity, a concept of physics, is crucial to power the chip, but without biology, the prospect of a power-efficient and effective supercomputer is hindered [4].</p>

		<p>Although there has been research conducted on simultaneous-performing computers before the biological computer, such as quantum computers, its components are “more easily disrupted” than the molecules in the biological computer [4]. A few months ago, Google’s quantum computer solved a complex problem that would take a supercomputer 10,000 years in 200 seconds. However, quantum computers cannot determine the range of qubits they can operate with, and eventually, entangled qubits quickly become untangled, being vulnerable to errors [5]. Despite Google’s feat, quantum computers are still a long way from being practical in reality. Physics is the building blocks to understanding numerous events in our world, but it is also through the application of other sciences that aids in efficient technological developments.</p>

		<p>In theory, every phenomenon can be reduced to physics. However, in reality, physics is not the most effective approach to understanding certain phenomena, nor the sole branch of science aiding in future technological advancements. It is impossible to ignore the other sciences and deem them as trivial as “stamp collecting”. As important and fundamental as physics is, the lines that compartmentalise the different sciences are blurred.</p>
