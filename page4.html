		<p>On April 10, 2019, scientists unveiled the first-ever image of the galaxy Messier 87’s supermassive black hole and its silhouette that is more than 50 million light-years away. This was achieved due to the Event Horizon Telescope project, with over 200 scientists collaborating and using a vast array of observatories from all parts of the world. When combined, this array resembles a telescope the size of our planet, which was able to collect a lot of data on this black hole since April 2017. Scientists then needed two years to assemble the numerous shots taken from all contributing observatories.</p>

		<p>Since black holes cannot be directly observed (light cannot escape their gravitational pull), before this, black holes were only studied and observed through indirect evidence such as capturing radiation from superheated matter contained in seemingly bizarre objects, “or by seeing the extremely energetic jets of particles launched from their tumultuous environments.”</p>

		<p>This image shows visual evidence of an event horizon, the light bending around the black hole, and hence, is a remarkable moment where visual evidence of a black hole’s existence is finally provided.</p>
