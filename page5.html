		<p>Recently, Google has claimed that its quantum computing breakthrough could be used to  solve large-scale issues that would have otherwise been deemed “impossible”. The company designed an experimental processor which could finish a calculation in minutes, whereas a traditional supercomputer would have required 10,000 years to complete. Some issues that quantum computing may solve include allowing for more “efficient distribution of limited resources” and aiding in the development of new drugs. In addition, quantum computing could greatly drive artificial intelligence forward.</p>
