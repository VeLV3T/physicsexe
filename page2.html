		<p>For my Personal Project in Grade 10, I taught Grade 7 students the fundamental terms and topics that revolve around the physics of music.</p>

		<p>The use of diagrams and a live experiment were helpful, but my main medium to teach these terms was through violin demonstrations, explaining certain physics phenomena that can be applied in many musical fields, especially to other stringed-instruments, such as when I bow, tighten the strings or pluck the strings. I have delved into topics such as harmonics, superpositions, standing waves, nodes and antinodes, and Mersenne’s law, which were all very unfamiliar to me in Grade 10, and thus even more alien to the Grade 7 students. </p>

		<p>Since my target audience was the Grade 7 students at the time and only had 15 minutes to teach them, my lesson had to be very basic, and hence, I may have oversimplified some terms or may have explained the concept but did not explicitly state the term (e.g. Mersenne’s Law). </p>

		<p>Slight warning, sorry for the bad violin playing skills! I was and still am a relatively new player!</p>
